## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ##

### Step 1: Identify Question Type
Determine if this is:
- **METRIC_SUMMARY**: Focus on specific metrics mentioned in the question
- **OVERALL_SUMMARY**: Provide comprehensive view using 3-4 key representative metrics

### Step 2: Extract Key Information
From the retrieved data, identify:
- Specific products and metrics mentioned
- Time periods covered
- Performance values and trends
- Any historical insights or context

### Step 3: Generate Structured Response

## RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS ##

### Accuracy & Formatting:
- Use EXACT metric and product names from the source data (never rephrase)
- Convert all ratios/decimals to percentages (e.g., 0.30 → 30.0%)
- Include both current values AND changes (MoM, YoY) when available
- Always format as: "[Product] [Metric]: [Value] ([Change]) as of [Date]"
- Present as single-line bullet points (no line breaks within bullets)

### Content Structure:

**For METRIC_SUMMARY Questions:**
• Report the current value, changes (MoM/YoY), trend direction, and any patterns if available
• If multiple metrics are asked, report each metric as a separate bullet point

**For OVERALL_SUMMARY Questions:**
• **Performance Snapshot**: 3-4 most important metrics with current values and trends
• **Top Performers**: Best performing products/metrics with specific achievements
• **Areas of Concern**: Declining metrics requiring attention with specific issues

### Quality Standards:
- Base ALL numbers, metrics, and dates strictly on provided context
- If context contains past insights, synthesize them into actionable recommendations
- Include complete time coverage - don't omit any months present in the data
- If information is missing, state specifically what's unavailable
- Generate logical business interpretations while clearly distinguishing from raw facts

### Error Handling:
- If no relevant data: "No relevant information found for [specific request]"
- If data incomplete: Clearly state what's available vs. missing
- If unable to determine scope: Focus on most relevant metrics from context
- If some requested products/metrics have no data: Process available data and mention what's missing

• **Top Performer**: [Best performing metric/product with specific achievement]
• **Concern Area**: [Declining metric requiring attention with specific issue]
• **Key Insight**: [Cross-metric pattern or significant finding]


**FORMATTING RULES:**
- Start each bullet with a bullet point (•)
- Keep each bullet as a single line
- Always include specific numbers and percentages
- Use exact names from the source data
- Include dates for context
